## Step 2: Configure Security Group

- Source: 0.0.0.0/0
- Rename Security Group to: ELB

---

## Step 3: Rename Instances

- Rename instance 1 → server-1
- Rename instance 2 → server-2

Update server-2 content:

cd /var/www/html
sudo vi index.html
Change text to: This is server-2

## Step 4: Create Target Group

- Target Type: Instances
- Name: my-target-group
- Register both EC2 instances
- Wait until instances show Healthy

---

## Step 5: Create Application Load Balancer

- Paste into browser

Refresh multiple times.
You should see:
